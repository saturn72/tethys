# Storybook

Storybook runs outside of your app.

So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app-specific dependencies and requirements.
Run `npm run storybook` to run the storybook dev-server, the server runs on port `6006`.

To build a static copy of storybook, run `npm run build-storybook`.

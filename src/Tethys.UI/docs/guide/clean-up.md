# Delete files that you don't need for your project

At this point, your project contains a lot of code that is just for demo purposes.

We recommend that you delete this code because your use-cases will be completely different from the demo use-cases.

## Directories and Files

Directories and files that we would recommend to delete:

```bash
├── docs
└── src
    ├── app
    │   ├── components
    │   └── counter
    └── server
        └── routes
            ├── CounterRoutes.ts
            └── DemoRoutes.ts
```

## Code

Now you have to remove references to this modules, remove the following code in the following files:

`./src/app/router.ts`
```js
import { CounterRoutes }    from './counter/routes';
import { ComponentsRoutes } from './components/routes';

...

      ...CounterRoutes,
      ...ComponentsRoutes,
```

`./src/app/state.ts`
```js
import { CounterDefaultState, ICounterState } from './counter/state';

...

  counter?: ICounterState;

...

  counter: {
    ...CounterDefaultState(),
  },
```

`./src/app/store.ts`
```js
import { CounterModule }        from './counter/module';

...

store.registerModule(['counter'], CounterModule, { preserveState: true });

...
  delete localState.counter.incrementPending;
  delete localState.counter.decrementPending;
...
```

And the server-side routes:

`./src/server/server.ts`
```js
import { DemoRoutes }       from './routes/DemoRoutes';
import { CounterRoutes }    from './routes/CounterRoutes';

...

/**
 * routes to demonstrate the possibilities of the vue-starter
 * can be removed if you don't need them in your application
 */
DemoRoutes(app);
CounterRoutes(app);
```

## Verification

Now you have a clean app and you can start creating your own application.

You should still see the vue-starter home page if you open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
But other routes should redirect to the `/not-found` page.

::: tip Does it still work?
To verify that your changes did not break something, run `npm test`.
